This package is designed to streamline the modeling work, especially for scoring. It provides some handy function to bin numerical variables, replace numerical variables with Weight of Evidence (WOE), ranking varialbes by Information Values (IV), plotting the successful/failure rates, check model performance based on AUC, and so on.This package also provides the useful function to convert the model output (e.g., coefficients) to graph/tables that are easier to understand for non-technical audience.
