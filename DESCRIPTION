Description: This package is designed to streamline the modeling work,
    especially for scoring. It provides some handy function to bin numerical
    variables, replace numerical variables with Weight of Evidence (WOE), ranking
    varialbes by Information Values (IV), plotting the successful/failure rates,
    check model performance based on AUC.This package also provides the useful
    function to convert the model output (e.g., coefficients) to graph/tables that
    are easier to understand for non-technical audience.
