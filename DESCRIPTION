Description: This package is designed to streamline the modeling work, especially
    for scoring. It provides some handy function to bin numerical variables,
    replace numerical variables with Weight of Evidence (WOE), ranking varialbes
    by Information Values (IV), plotting the successful/failure rates, check model
    performance based on AUC.This package also provides the useful function to
    convert the model output (e.g., coefficients) to graph/tables that are easier
    to understand for non-technical audience.
